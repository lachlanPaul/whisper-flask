# Whisper Flask
This is a server using Flask that communicates with OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe an audio file, and then uses the transcribed text to get a response from ChatGPT.

This was originally made for my Pepper Robot x ChatGPT project, which can be found [here.](github.com/lachlanPaul/pepper-gpt)
As such, it has some training based around being Pepper bot, which can easily be altered.
